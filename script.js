// Kelvin Weather - With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

const kelvin = 0;
const celsius = kelvin - 273;
let fahrenheit = celsius * (9/5) + 32;
fahrenheit = Math.floor(fahrenheit);
let newton = celsius * (33/100);
newton = Math.floor(newton);

console.log(`The temperature is ${fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit.`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${newton} degrees Newton.`);


//Dog Years - Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”: The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each. Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

let myAge = 26;
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears *= 10.5;
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
laterYears *= 4; 

console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);

let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

let myName = 'Angelina'.toLowerCase();

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
